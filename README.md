## Notes

- The script sets the system locale to `ru_RU.UTF-8`. Change this if you prefer another language.
- NVIDIA DRM modeset and modules are configured for optimal Wayland/NVIDIA support.
- All dotfiles and configs in `.config` will be copied to your home directory.
- The script assumes you are running it as your regular user with `sudo` access.
- Additional desktop apps (like Beekeeper Studio, OBS Studio) are installed at the end.

## Troubleshooting

- If Hyprland or any package fails to install, the script will output the error log and exit.
- For NVIDIA-specific issues, ensure your hardware is compatible with the open drivers.
- If you need to customize which apps or themes are installed, edit `install.sh` before running.
